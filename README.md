# pythonforphysicists -- ipython notebooks to learn python

These ipython notebooks were made for an informal course on python taught by myself at the Universtiy of Texas at Brownsville during 2013 to fellow graduate students who wanted to learn Python.

They were written mostly before the class, and then modified during the class, as people would ask questions. The final state of them is how they were left at the end of the classes. I may go and clean them up in the future.

I hope these may be of help to others who want to learn python while using the ipython notebook.
